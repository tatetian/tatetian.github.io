Hey there!

My name is Tate, Hongliang Tian (or 田洪亮 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. 
candidate majoring in computer science. I am more fond of building novel 
systems than studying theoretical problems. I consider myself as a full-stack 
developer:

- Write the firmware of a Solid-State Drive in C? [No problem]().
- Build a fancy HTML5 Web app backed by Ruby on Rails? [Done]().
- Collaborate with artists to invent an interactive installation? [Look]().

My motto as a hacker is [*make something useful*](http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html).
Fine. I lied. I constantly make stuffs for fun. LOL.

In my spare time, I play finger-style guitar. And I am passionate about Ultimate 
Frisbee. I have the privilege of being the captain of the varsity Ultimate 
team.

Thanks for reading!
