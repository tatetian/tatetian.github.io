Hey there!

My name is **Tate, Hongliang Tian** (or **田洪亮** in Chinese). You are visiting my 
home on the Internet, where I share thoughts on programming, technology 
and <a href="#trustedlibc">startup</a>. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate majoring in computer science, [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn).
As a researcher, I am interested in *data management* and *data security* issues, 
especailly those regarding with *cloud computing*. As a developer, I consider myself 
as "full-stack" in the sense that I have a wide range of project experience
from very low-level, hardware-facing hacks to very high-level, user-interactive stuffs:

- Write the *firmware* and *driver* of a Solid-State Drive? [No 
  problem](#trustedssd).
- Invent an *OS system call* mechanism for an emerging platform? [Enable the 
  impossible](#trustedlibc).
- Architect a *cloud platform* for *Big Data analytics*? [Done right](#huadingml).
- Build a fancy *HTML5 Web app* backed by Ruby on Rails? [Won a 
  hackathon](#paperclub).
- Play with sensors and chips to make *interative installation art*? [Audience amazed](#touchstarrynight).

My motto as a hacker is [*make something useful*](http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html).
Well, actually, I can't stop making stuffs just for fun. LOL.

In my spare time, I play [finger-style guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerstyle_guitar).
And I am passionate about [Ultimate Frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)).
I had the privilege of being the captain of the varsity Ultimate team.

Thanks for reading!
